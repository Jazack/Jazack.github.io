# A Brief History of Faerune
#### Or what the average person knows
   The first thing that people know about is the War of the Deities, a massive war that took place affecting who the Deities are and how much power they have in this world.  All the Deities fought for power. However the majority of them, through time, were exiled from the world as they lost all of their followers.

   From that point three major nations arose, the Elves, the Humans, and the Dwarves, these were all favored of the good Deities, while many of the evil Deities sent their followers into hiding (such as the goblins), or underground (such as the drow).  Legends also speak of a group of people that fled the domain of the Deities altogether, however no one knows more of these people, or whether they really exist at all.

  The three nations above the ground began to have rivalries with each other as to whose Deities are the most powerful, as such different competitions go on throughout the year so as to prove whose Deities are the most powerful, during said times, tensions can be high between the different races.

   There was a time where a lesser known god stopped being a god, and several took its place, these being: Ice, Akmed Jihadi, Fward Sweech, Irea Vale, Vandilar Rildyn-dra, Ragnar Danneskjold. However, in current times, several gods have lost their power.

# A Brief Explanation of the Main Town
#### Or what the average person knows
   The main town that the players come from is [Shadow Fell](Shadow%20Fell/Shadow%20Fell.md), which is near the Human Elven Border.  This is a popular town for adventuring parties, and as such many normal people come there to seek the aid of the Adventurers.

    A brief side note:  Adventurers are people that have been blessed by different Deities, whether as a favor to a particularly devout follower, or because the Deity could see a particular destiny in that child.  Whatever the cause the Deity has bestowed upon the adventurer blessings in either Constitution, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.  Some of the Adventurers start out knowing which Deity has blessed them, while others are in search of that Deity.

   The town of Shadow Fell was once a dangerous area, infested by the Necromancers, and it is where many fell.  After this many adventurers originally sought a sanctuary in this area from the constant demands of the commoners.  However, as the commoners saw that more and more adventurers were only going to Shadow Fell, the commoners started to go there to pester the adventurers into going on their quests.

   The city's mayor is [Mer](Shadow%20Fell/Mer.md). They do not have a standing army.  If any army is foolhardy enough to try and attack the town, the adventurers there will retaliate, the last attempt of this was by an army of goblins, and they were quickly destroyed.  

# A Brief History of the Kings of the Humans
#### Or what the Average Person Knows

   The Human Empire (Fedornia) was established by King Fedor (FEH-dawr), the first of the Human kings.  Everyone of them (with few exceptions) have been blessed by the Deities with Wisdom so as to be able to guide their kingdom and overcome the hordes of creatures that follow the evil aligned Deities.

   An old king was Chernobog the betrayer after he set his brother to die from the goblin invasion. Since then, while a cult has formed around Chernobog due to some scriptures, the people of Ferdonia generally avoid naming people Chernobog.

   The current king is Blagorodnyy.

   The capital is called Cherkessk (CER-keesk), it has a population of around 129 thousand people.

# A Brief History of the Kings of the Elves
#### Or What the Average Person Knows

   The Elvish Empire (Nihon) was established by Jinmu-tennō, the first Elvish Emperor.  Currently the Elvish Emperor is Hibiki (hee-bee-kee), and his wife is Kuroyukihime (coo-row-yu-kee-hee-may).  

   The elves, from what most people have observed, usually try to maintain a unity with nature.  Many specialize in archery and martial arts. 

    Cultural reference:  if someone is given 23 Wadōkaichin (a black stone), that means to stop whatever it is that you are doing, and, usually, go buy a particularly strong drink so as to make you stay quiet.

# A Brief History of the Kings of the Dwarves
#### Or What the Average Person Knows

   The Dwarvish Empire (Keltoi) was established by Alina.  Currently Nolan is the king of Keltoi, and Aodh is his wife.  We say king, however it would be more accurate to say Chief Chieftain, for the Keltoi empire is made up of many different tribes with different leaders, and many various rules and regulations.  Yet all are united under Nolan.

   The Dwarves are mostly miners, and they enjoy drinking, a lot.  Naturally they are magic resistant, and have little use for most common magics.  As such they are more specialized in the clerical magics and fighting.

# A Brief History of the Outsiders
#### Or What the Average Person Knows

   The Outsiders, or the uncivilized races, are quite numerous, and very little is known about them.  The Goblins are known to reside in the forests, and to be quite superstitious, whereas the Drow reside in the Underdark and are not superstitious.  There are also many tells of strange creatures at the sea, as such most people decide not to go anywhere near there.

# A Brief History of Fedornia
#### Or what the Average Person Knows
    This section contains a more expanded amount of information, for specifics on the kings of Fedornia, please refer to the third section of this once brief (but now not so brief) history of the world.

   Fedornia has four main provinces, Voyna (Vie-na), Ferma (Fear-muh), Tek (Tealk, almost like two, yet still one, if that makes any sense), and Pravit’ (Pri-vit).  Voyna is where the main war headquarters are, wherein are the largest barracks, training grounds, ect.. Ferma is the main source of agriculture for the kingdom, the towns therein are usually smaller and more rural.  Tek is the technological center of Fedornia, it’s there that the scholars go to study, and it’s there that people have recently invented a method to raise water using a tube and a giant corkscrew like item.  And Pravit’ is the capital province of Fedornia, it’s there that the king resides (in the capital of Pravit’ of course), and it’s there that all political matters are discussed.

   The current leaders of the land, after King Blagorodnyy of course, is Iosif (YO-seef), the king’s cousin, and the baron of Pravit’, next is Kazimir (kah-zee-MEER), who is the baron over Voyna and the head general over the Ferdornia armies.  Kostya (KAWST-yah) is the baron over Ferma.  And Lyosha (LYAW-shah) is the baron over Tek.

   Under these four barons falls all of Ferdonia.  And Shadow Fell is found on the border of Tek and Nihon
